# Templates

This repo contains deployment templates and scripts to allow testing and re-use across courses

## Guidelines for use

- Create a folder named `service-verb` i.e. sentinel-deploy, in the main brach
- Do not use uppercase for file or folder names, all words should  be lower case.
- Place the template, script file/s into this folder.
- This should al be done in the `main` branch, not a new branch.
